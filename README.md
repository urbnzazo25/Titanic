Code in which I tackle the [Titanic](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/) challenge on Kaggle. Starting from a training dataset in which each row contains a passenger on the Titanic with information on whether or not they died as the target variable, the challenge consists of predicting the latter for the test set.

The main parts of the code are the notebooks:
- **data_analysis**, where data analysis is performed
- **data_cleaning_preprocessing**, where the dataset is cleaned and made readable for a supervised machine learning task
- **ml_model**, where different machine learning models are tested

The best result obtained was **0.77272** through Logistic Regression.
