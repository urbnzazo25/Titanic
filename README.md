Code in which I tackle the [Titanic](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/) challenge on Kaggle.

The main parts of the code are the notebooks:
- **data_analysis**, where data analysis is performed
- **data_cleaning_preprocessing**, where the dataset is cleaned and made readable for a supervised machine learning task
- **ml_model**, where different machine learning models are tested

Il miglior risultato ottenuto è stato **0.77272** attraverso una Logistic Regression.
